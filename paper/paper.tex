\section{Introduction}

Embedded domain specific languages (EDSLs) have long been a useful and effective
technique for constructing reusable tools for writing programs for a variety of
different problem domains. Haskell is a language which is particularly
well-suited to EDSLs due to its lazy evaluation, first-class functions and
lexical closures.

\subsection{Overview}

In this EDSL, the type representing values in the expression language is \ttt{E t}
and there are two basic functions which translate values to and from this
expression language with the following type signatures:

\begin{lstlisting}
rep :: a -> E a
abs :: E a -> a
\end{lstlisting}

In this paper, the data constructors of the \ttt{E} type will be described
incrementally as they are needed.


\subsection{Translation Example} % TODO: Does it make sense for this to be a
                                 % subsection of the intro?


In the example below, \ttt{example} would get transformed into \ttt{example'}:

\begin{lstlisting}[deletekeywords={Ord}]
import Data.Char (ord)

x :: Either Char Int
x = Left 'a'

example :: Int
example =
  case x of
    Left  c -> ord c
    Right i -> i

example' :: Int
example' =
  abs (CaseExp
        (rep x)
        (SumMatchExp (OneProdMatch
                       (Lam 1 (Ord (Var 1))))
                     (OneSumMatch
                       (OneProdMatch
                         (Lam 2 (Var 2)))))
\end{lstlisting}

[\ldots]

\section{Representing Algebraic Datatypes}

Briefly, a algebraic type \ttt{T} with an automatically generated \ttt{ERep}
instance is given representation in terms of \ttt{Either}, \ttt{(,)},
\ttt{()} and \ttt{Void}. This "standardized" type representation is
given by \ttt{ERepTy T}. \ttt{ERepTy} is an type family associated to
the type class \ttt{ERep}. This type will be called the \textit{canonical type}
of \ttt{T}.

\subsection{GHC Generics \ttt{Rep}}

[Remove metadata from Generic representation and turn tree-like structure into a (nested) list-like structure]

\subsection{\ttt{E}, \ttt{ERep}, \ttt{ERepTy}}

There are three interconnected foundational parts: \ttt{E}, \ttt{ERep} and
\ttt{ERepTy}. \ttt{E} is the deep embedding of the EDSL (a GADT that encodes
expressions in the DSL language). \ttt{ERep} is a type class which represents
all Haskell types which can be represented in the DSL. \ttt{ERepTy} is a type
family associated to the \ttt{ERep} type class, which represents a "canonical form"
of the given type. This canonical form can be immediately constructed in the EDSL.
Canonical form types crucially include \ttt{Either} and \ttt{(,)}, which
allow all combinations of basic sum types and product types to be encoded. More
information on this encoding is given in [a different section].

This information is brought into the \ttt{E} type via the constructor
\ttt{Repped}. The \ttt{E} also contains constructors representing \ttt{Either}
and \ttt{(,)} values:

\begin{lstlisting}
data E t where
  ...
  Repped :: ERep t => ERepTy t -> E t

  LeftExp :: E a -> E (Either a b)
  RightExp :: E b -> E (Either a b)

  PairExp :: E a -> E b -> E (a, b)
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

\ttt{ERep} and \ttt{ERepTy} provide an interface for transferring values between the EDSL
world and the Haskell world:

\begin{lstlisting}
class ERep t where
  type ERepTy t

  rep :: t -> E t
  rep = Repped . rep'

  unrep :: ERepTy t -> t

  rep' :: t -> ERepTy t
\end{lstlisting}

The key algebraic instances mentioned before are as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
instance (ERep a, ERep b)
  => ERep (Either a b) where

  type ERepTy (Either a b) = Either a b

  rep (Left x)  = LeftExp (rep x)
  rep (Right y) = RightExp (rep y)

  unrep = id
  rep'  = id

instance (ERep a, ERep b)
  => ERep (a, b) where

  type ERepTy (a, b) = (a, b)

  rep (x, y) = PairExp (rep x) (rep y)
  unrep = id
  rep'  = id
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Representing pattern matches}

Within the \ttt{E} expression language, a pattern match is represented by the
\ttt{CaseExp} constructor:

\begin{lstlisting}
data E t where
  ...
  CaseExp ::
    (ERep t, ERepTy (ERepTy t) ~ ERepTy t)
      => ERep t
         -> E (SumMatch (ERepTy t) r)
         -> E r
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

The equality constraint ensures that a canonical type is its own canonical type.

\begin{tcolorbox}
  \textbf{TODO}: Should we make a synonym for this constraint since it is used in
multiple places? Like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
type CanonicalIsIdem t =
  ERepTy (ERepTy t) ~ ERepTy t
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

(The above code block is a slight simplification of the actual implementation,
which has an additional type variable which is used at an "intermediate" point.
The expanded form is in place to simplify the Core transformation.)

The type \ttt{SumMatch} is defined as

\begin{lstlisting}
newtype SumMatch a b =
  MkSumMatch { runSumMatch :: a -> b }
\end{lstlisting}

For the moment, we will primarily use this type as a type tag and ignore
the values it can take on.

A value of type \ttt{E (SumMatch a b)} represents a computation within the EDSL
which destructures a value of type \ttt{E a} and produces a value of type \ttt{E b}.
Therefore, \ttt{E (SumMatch (ERepTy t) r)} represents a computation which destructures
a value of type \ttt{E (ERepTy t)} and produces a value of type \ttt{E b}.



\subsection{\ttt{E (SumMatch a b)}}

The overall structure of a \ttt{E (SumMatch a b)} value is a (heterogeneous)
list of \ttt{E (ProdMatch x y)} values.  Each item of this list corresponds
exactly to one branch in the original \ttt{case} match.

The following constructors generate \ttt{SumMatch}-tagged values in the
expression language:

\begin{lstlisting}
data E t where
  ...
  SumMatchExp ::
    (ERep a, ERep b, ERepTy b ~ b)
      => E (ProdMatch a r)
         -> E (SumMatch b r)
         -> E (SumMatch (Either a b) r)

  OneSumMatch ::
    (ERep a, ERep b, ERepTy a ~ a)
      => E (ProdMatch a b)
         -> E (SumMatch a b)


  EmptyMatch ::
    (ERep b) => E (SumMatch Void b)
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

Note the \ttt{ERepTy a \typeeq a} constraints. This constraint ensures that the type
\ttt{a} is already in canonical form (that is, consists entirely of
\ttt{Either}, \ttt{(,)} and base types).

\subsection{\ttt{E (ProdMatch s t)}}

\ttt{E (ProdMatch x y)} is equivalent to a curried function from \ttt{x} to
\ttt{y} in the expression language .  Note that \ttt{s} is a (potentially
nested) pair type. For example, \ttt{E (ProdMatch (a, (b, c)) r)} is
equivalent to \ttt{E (a -> b -> c -> r)}.

\begin{lstlisting}
data E t where
  ...
  ProdMatchExp ::
    (ERep a, ERep b)
      => E (a -> ProdMatch b r)
         -> E (ProdMatch (a, b) r)

  NullaryMatch ::
    (ERep a)
      => E r -> E (ProdMatch a r)


  OneProdMatch ::
    (ERep a)
      => E (a -> b) -> E (ProdMatch a b)
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

The \ttt{ProdMatch} type is defined similarly to the \ttt{SumMatch} type and is
similiarly used primarily as a type tag:

\begin{lstlisting}
newtype ProdMatch a b =
  MkProdMatch { runProdMatch :: a -> b }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Connection to Church encodings}
TODO: Write this subsection

\subsection{An aside on \ttt{ProdMatch} and \ttt{SumMatch} values}

Though \ttt{ProdMatch} and \ttt{SumMatch} are used throughout this EDSL as type
tags, they do have values and they are not trivial values. The reason for this
is that it connects the encoded pattern matches (values from the \ttt{E}) type
to their semantics. A value of type \ttt{E (SumMatch a b)} is an expression
which takes in a value of type \ttt{a} (embedded within the expression
language), internally performs some pattern matching, and produces a value of
type \ttt{b} (again, embedded within the expression language). This is exactly
the semantics of a function from \ttt{a} to \ttt{b}. Likewise for \ttt{ProdMatch a b}.

Recall the previously mentioned function

\begin{lstlisting}
abs :: E a -> a
\end{lstlisting}

Now consider at the type of \ttt{abs} when it is specialized to take
\ttt{E (SumMatch a b)} values:

\begin{lstlisting}
abs :: E (SumMatch a b) -> SumMatch a b
\end{lstlisting}

The \ttt{SumMatch a b} value which \ttt{abs} returns is exactly the function
which pattern matches according to its input value.

Likewise for \ttt{ProdMatch a b} values.

\section{Representing tail recursion}
\begin{tcolorbox}
  \textbf{TODO}: Expand this section
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{lstlisting}
data Iter a b = Step b | Done a
  deriving (Functor, Generic)

runIter :: (ERep a, ERep b)
  => (a -> Iter b a)
     -> (a -> b)
runIter f = go
  where
    go x =
      case f x of
        Done r  -> r
        Step x' -> go x'
\end{lstlisting}

In the \ttt{E} type, this is used to represent tail recursion by
the following constructors:

\begin{lstlisting}
data E t where
  ...
  StepExp :: E b -> E (Iter a b)
  DoneExp :: E a -> E (Iter a b)

  TailRec :: (ERep a, ERep b)
               => E (b -> Iter a b)
                  -> E (b -> a)
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Representing lambdas}
This representation of pattern matching depends on the ability to bring
function values into the expression language. This is accomplished
with the following constructors:

\begin{lstlisting}
data E t where
  ...
  Lam ::
    (ERep a, Typeable a)
      => Name a -> E b -> E (a -> b)

  Var :: (Typeable a) => Name a -> E a
\end{lstlisting}

The \ttt{Typeable} constraints are necessary to lookup correctly typed
values in the variable binding environment later on.

The \ttt{Name t} type represents a lambda variable identifier together with its
type \ttt{t}:

\begin{lstlisting}
newtype Name a = Name Int
  deriving (Eq, Show)

namesEq :: forall a b.
  (Typeable a, Typeable b)
    => Name a -> Name b -> Maybe (a :~: b)
namesEq (Name n) (Name n') =
  case eqT :: Maybe (a :~: b) of
    Just Refl
      | n == n' -> Just Refl
      | otherwise -> Nothing
    Nothing   -> Nothing
\end{lstlisting}

(Note that the \ttt{ScopedTypeVariables} extension is enabled.)

In the Core transformation, each lambda is given a \ttt{Name} with a globally
unique \ttt{Int}, sidestepping any name capture issues.

The following datatypes are used to represent a variable binding environment
of typed names to expression language values:

\begin{lstlisting}
data EnvMapping where
  (:=>) :: forall a.
    Typeable a
    => Name a -> E a -> EnvMapping
\end{lstlisting}

This type encodes a single variable binding, with values of the form
\ttt{n :=> v}, where \ttt{n} is a typed name and \ttt{v} is the value it is bound to.

These bindings are grouped together in the \ttt{Env} type:

\begin{lstlisting}
newtype Env = Env [EnvMapping]

emptyEnv :: Env
emptyEnv = Env []

extendEnv :: Env -> EnvMapping -> Env
extendEnv (Env maps) m = Env (m:maps)

envLookup :: Typeable a
  => Env -> Name a -> Maybe (E a)
envLookup (Env maps) = go maps
  where
    go []                = Nothing

    go ((n' :=> e):rest) =
      case namesEq n n' of
        Just Refl -> Just e
        Nothing   -> go rest
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Recovering standard semantics for pattern matches}

\begin{lstlisting}
abs :: forall t. E t -> t
abs = absEnv emptyEnv

sumMatchAbs ::
  (ERepTy (ERepTy s) ~ ERepTy s, ERep s)
  => Env
    -> E (SumMatch (ERepTy s) t)
    -> s
    -> t
...

prodMatchAbs :: (ERep s)
  => Env
     -> E (ProdMatch s t)
     -> s
     -> t
...

absEnv :: forall t. Env -> E t -> t
absEnv env (CaseExp x f) =
  sumMatchAbs f (absEnv env x)

absEnv env (LeftExp x) =
  Left (absEnv env x)

absEnv env (RightExp y) =
  Right (absEnv env y)

absEnv env (PairExp x y) =
  (absEnv env x, absEnv env y)

absEnv env (Repped x) = unrep x

absEnv env env (Var v) =
  case envLookup env v of
    Just x -> absEnv env
    Nothing ->
      error
        ("No binding for name "
          ++ show v)

...
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Core Plugin}

The Core plugin translates marked expressions. Expressions are marked by
the \ttt{externalize} function:

\begin{lstlisting}
externalize :: a -> E a
\end{lstlisting}

So, \ttt{externalize x} marks the expression \ttt{x}.

If an expression already has an EDSL type (a type of the form \ttt{E a} for some
\ttt{a}), then it does the marking procedure ignores it and does not wrap it with
\ttt{externalize}.

Note that the total number of marks introduced is upper bounded by the number of
subexpressions in the original Core given to the transformation by GHC and each
full transformation step (that is, $C$) eliminates one mark. Therefore, the
transformation will terminate.


\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}

%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%   the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%   Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%   a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%   divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%   book \cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
%   symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
%   \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
%   \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
%   \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
%   doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
%   \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
%   \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
%   \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and
%   (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
%   publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%   \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
%   contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
%   \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
%   multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
%   couple of citations with DOIs:
%   \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online
%   citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}. Artifacts:
%   \cite{R} and \cite{UMassCitations}.

% \section{Acknowledgments}

%Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
%individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
%preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
%section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
%document.

%This section has a special environment:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \begin{acks}
%  ...
%  \end{acks}
%\end{verbatim}
%so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
%during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
%consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

%Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

%\section{Appendices}

%If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
%``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
%document.

%Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  \appendix
%\end{verbatim}
%and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
%numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
%and subsection identification method.

%\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

%The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
%not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
%a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
%``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
%the margin:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
%\item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
%\item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
%\end{itemize}

%%%
%%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%%% consistent spelling of the heading.
%\begin{acks}
%To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
%\end{acks}

%%%
%%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%%% the bibliography file.
%\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%\bibliography{sample-base}

%%%
%%% If your work has an appendix, this is the place to put it.
