# Possible Future Work and Research Ideas

## Futures and promises for parallelism in the EDSL

Consider the following code:

    data Future a = Future

    data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)

    type FutureTree a = Tree (Future a)

    data Child = LeftChild | RightChild
    type TreePath = [Child]

    parMapTree :: Tree a -> Expr (a -> TreePath -> b) -> Tree b

Consider an implementation of `parMapTree` which sends the computation over to a
GPU.

Calling `parMapTree` with a `FutureTree` allows us to generate the leaf values
of a tree in parallel when we know (and *only* know) the structure of the tree
before the parallel computation gets sent to the GPU.

The entire structure of the `FutureTree` is known before `parMapTree` is
executed. This means the entire tree structure is known before the computation
is sent to the GPU. Additionally, for this particular type, the `Expr`
representation of a `TreePath`, from the perspective of the GPU, could be a more
compressed efficient form (such as a bitstring where a 0 indicates the left
child and a 1 indicates a right child).

Each leaf value could be computed by the GPU in parallel and then put into the
appropriate places in the `Tree` (whose shape has already been fixed). Putting
the values into the tree could possibly happen either on the GPU or the CPU.

Specializing a bit, we could additionally have:

    parMapFTree :: FutureTree a -> Expr (TreePath -> a) -> Tree a

In this function, the only information the GPU needs to know is the shape of
the tree.

Now consider the following function which, again, could be done in parallel on a
GPU:

    parTreeReduce :: Tree a -> Expr (a -> a -> a) -> a

This could be composed with the previous map function to obtain this tree
map/reduce:

    parTreeMapReduce :: Tree a -> Expr (a -> TreePath -> b) -> Expr (a -> a -> a) -> a
    parTreeMapReduce ft map_fn reduce_fn = parTreeReduce (parMapTree ft map_fn) reduce_fn

An unfold tree operation could also be implemented and used in compositions with
the previous functions.
